# Weather for runners
This Next.js app, built with React, is designed to showcase some of my favorite running spots, complete with live weather updates. By using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), the app provides real-time weather data for each location. The reason behind the app is to encourage everyone to get outside and stay active, no matter what the weather looks like.

Whether it's sunny or stormy, these running spots are worth exploring, and this app provides the information you need to prepare. Check out current temperatures, conditions, and more for top running destinations, and get inspired to embrace the elements and keep moving.

## Tech details

This project was bootstrapped with Next.js, using create-next-app.

### Getting Started

To run the development server:
